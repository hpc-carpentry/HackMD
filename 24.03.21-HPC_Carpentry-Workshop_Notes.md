## An introduction to parallelisation and workflow automation by Alan O'Cais and Peter Steinbach

With this single day introduction, we want to take your HPC cluster skills to the next level. We plan to introduce automated pipelines and parallelization suited to our learners. We assume that learners are able to submit single jobs to a SLURM based scheduler and have a basic understanding of the UNIX shell and Python. For parallelization, we aim to provide a thorough introduction on how to approach implementing data parallelism in Python. For this, we will use shared memory parallelisation using multiprocessing and distributed memory parallelisation using message-passing-interface for a compute intensive problem. The day will be concluded with an introduction on how to automate pipelines on a cluster - which are typically found with data intensive tasks. All teaching will be performed hands-on on a custom cluster provided to the students.

## ice breakers

### Share with us a mythical creture from the region where you grew up! Share what people attribute to this creature.

# Introduction to Parallelisation

## Jargon Busting

This exercise will guide us through the first half of the day. 

1. Split up in 3 teams! 
2. We will send you into break-out rooms.  
For each team: **Talk for three minutes on any terms, phrases, or ideas around parallelisation or HPC that you’ve come across and perhaps feel you should know better.** Collect these terms below.

A list of terms/phrases/ideas around parallelisation or HPC that you’ve come across and perhaps feel you should know better (Retain duplicates.):

3. We will send you into break-out rooms again.  
For each team: **Identify common words from the list above as a starting point - spend 10 minutes working together to try to explain what the terms, phrases, or ideas on your list mean.** Note: use both each other and the internet as a resource. Identify the terms your groups were able to explain as well as those you are still struggling with.

## Notes

In this part of the course, we will go through HPC Carpentries' [hpc-parallel-novice](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-parallel-novice/). In case anyone has to leave, this is the material we are teaching and to which you can return on your own in any case.

Note that this material is in alpha stage. In case you discover bugs/errors, feel free to let us know or submit an issue to the [repo](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-parallel-novice/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). 








# Lunch break

## Please share with us something that you liked or you understood in the morning session :+1: 


## Please share with us something that you didn't like, were confused about or want us to improve :-1: 


# Introduction to Automating Workflows

In this part of the course, we will go through the second half of HPC Carpentries' [hpc-python](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-python/07-snakemake-intro/index.html) lesson. In case anyone has to leave, this is the material we are teaching and to which you can return on your own in any case.
