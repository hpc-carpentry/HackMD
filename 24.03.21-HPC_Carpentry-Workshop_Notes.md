## An introduction to parallelisation and workflow automation by Alan O'Cais and Peter Steinbach

With this single day introduction, we want to take your HPC cluster skills to the next level. We plan to introduce automated pipelines and parallelization suited to our learners. We assume that learners are able to submit single jobs to a SLURM based scheduler and have a basic understanding of the UNIX shell and Python. For parallelization, we aim to provide a thorough introduction on how to approach implementing data parallelism in Python. For this, we will use shared memory parallelisation using multiprocessing and distributed memory parallelisation using message-passing-interface for a compute intensive problem. The day will be concluded with an introduction on how to automate pipelines on a cluster - which are typically found with data intensive tasks. All teaching will be performed hands-on on a custom cluster provided to the students.
