# HackMD Notes Repository

This repository is a synching location for notes created on https://hackmd.io by the
[HPC Carpentry Team there](https://hackmd.io/team/hpc-carpentry). To join the team on
HackMD, please open an issue in this repo (since I can't find another way to request
that right now).

The idea is to keep a more permanent record of of the various meetings (coordination,
task force, etc.). It also open up the possibility of maintaining a record of notes taken
during any HPC Carpentry (or related) workshops.
