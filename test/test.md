# Training Courses Flowchart

This image appears in the [ARCHER2 Training Courses](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/) to help guide learners through the available materials. It provides a helpful overview of what's available, and roughly delineates what resources would be most useful to researchers coming from various backgrounds (or focus areas). Recycling the concept, if not the image itself, would be a boon to HPC Carpentries learners.
